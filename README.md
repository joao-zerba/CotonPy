# CotonPy
CotonPy - X-Ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy Software

This is a software for X-ray photon spectroscopy analysis, written in Python for Linux. It features an intuitive graphical user interface developed using the Tkinter Python library.

The input consists of experimental scattering images in HDF5, NumPy, or binary file formats. The outputs include two-time, multi-tau, and one-time correlation curves, provided in HDF5 and NumPy formats.

Some of the main libraries you will need:

Tkinter
h5py
NumPy
Matplotlib
PIL

# Installation:

After downloading the folders, update the “root_folder” variable by specifying the path to the main directory. Once updated, simply run the Main.py file to start the software.
